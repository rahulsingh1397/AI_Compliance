- Reimplemented `NLPModel` for enhanced performance, accuracy, and handling of long documents.
- **Chunked Text Processing**: Implemented chunking with configurable stride and size to allow BERT models to process documents of any length.
- **Hybrid PII Detection**: Integrated BERT NER, spaCy NER, and custom regex patterns for comprehensive PII detection.
  - **BERT NER**: Processes text in chunks, with logic to map chunk-level entity offsets back to the full document.
  - **spaCy EntityRuler**: Dynamically adds custom regex patterns from a central `pii_definitions` dictionary, making PII rules easier to manage.
- **Advanced Aggregation and Deduplication**:
  - `classify_document` now aggregates classification scores from all chunks to determine the final document sensitivity.
  - `detect_pii` combines entities found by both BERT and spaCy and performs deduplication to provide a clean, final list.
- **Robust Model Loading**: Corrected BERT NER model loading to use `AutoModelForTokenClassification` and improved spaCy pipeline configuration.

### Structured Data Scanning (Database) ✅
- **Database Scanning Capability**: Implemented the `scan_database` method in the `DataDiscoveryAgent` to scan and classify structured data.
- **ML Classifier Integration**: The new method fully integrates the `MLClassifier` to predict sensitive data in database tables.
- **Automated Schema and Table Discovery**: The agent automatically inspects the database to find all schemas and tables to scan.
- **Efficient Data Handling**: Uses `pandas` to efficiently sample and process data from tables.
- **Robust and Resilient**: Includes Tenacity-based retry logic to handle transient database connection errors.

6. **Database Connection Pooling** ✅
   - Implemented SQLAlchemy QueuePool for connection management
   - Configurable pool size and overflow settings
   - Improved database connection efficiency and reliability

7. **Encoding Detection** ✅
   - Added automatic file encoding detection using chardet
   - More robust handling of different text encodings
   - Reduces encoding-related errors when processing diverse files

8. **Health Monitoring** ✅
   - Added health check functionality to monitor component status
   - Enables operational monitoring and alerting
   - Provides better visibility into system operational state

These enhancements improve the robustness, maintainability, and performance of the Data Discovery Agent while ensuring better resource utilization and error recovery.




## Updates - 2025-06-11

1.  **Chardet Memory Optimization (`agent.py`)**:
    *   Modified file reading to use only the first 10KB for encoding detection with `chardet`. This prevents `MemoryError` when processing very large files.

2.  **Chunk Count Accuracy and Propagation**:
    *   `nlp_model.py`:
        *   `classify_document`: Now correctly calculates and returns `chunk_count` (number of text chunks processed by the BERT pipeline).
        *   `analyze_document`: Now correctly retrieves `chunk_count` from `classify_document` and includes it in its return dictionary.
    *   `agent.py`:
        *   `scan_unstructured_data`: Updated to correctly use `full_analysis_result.get('chunk_count', 1)` when storing metadata for text-based files, resolving previous `NameError: name 'chunks' is not defined`.

3.  **Large CSV File Handling (`agent.py`)**:
    *   Implemented robust, memory-efficient processing for large CSV files within `scan_unstructured_data`.
    *   Uses `pandas.read_csv` with a `chunksize` (e.g., 10,000 rows) to stream data.
    *   For each chunk, iterates through columns, concatenates textual content, and passes it to `self.nlp_model.analyze_document()` for sensitive data analysis.
    *   Aggregates findings (sensitivity status, PII types, NLP chunk counts) across all pandas chunks and columns for the entire CSV.
    *   Stores detailed column-level analysis along with overall document metadata.

4.  **SpaCy Sentencizer Configuration (`nlp_model.py`)**:
    *   Enhanced `NLPModel.__init__` to explicitly add the `sentencizer` component to the spaCy pipeline if it's not already present (e.g., `self.nlp.add_pipe('sentencizer', first=True)`).
    *   This resolves the "spaCy sentencizer not available" warning and ensures more reliable sentence boundary detection for the `_chunk_text_by_sentences` method.

5.  **Enhanced PII Detection (`nlp_model.py`, 2025-06-11)**:
    *   Expanded BERT NER entity type mapping to include more entity formats (B-PER, I-PER, MISC, etc.)
    *   Added enhanced logging with model information and sample entity detection
    *   Added regex pattern matching for common PII formats (emails, phone numbers) when few entities are detected
    *   Implemented more lenient confidence thresholds (minimum 0.5) to catch more potential PII
    *   Improved entity deduplication with fuzzy matching to better handle overlapping entities
    *   Added detailed logging of entity detection process for easier debugging

6.  **Multicore Processing Enhancements (`nlp_model.py`, 2025-06-11)**:
    *   Implemented parallelized document analysis in `analyze_document` method using ThreadPoolExecutor
    *   Added automatic CPU core detection and optimal allocation for batch processing
    *   Enhanced `_process_chunks_in_batches` to use multiprocessing with optimal core utilization
    *   Added fallback to multiprocessing.Pool when Datasets library is unavailable
    *   Implemented detailed performance tracking with processing statistics (chars/second)
    *   Added intelligent parallelization that only uses multiple cores for larger texts (>5000 chars)
