# Privacy-Preserving Agent

The Privacy-Preserving Agent provides advanced privacy and security mechanisms for AI systems to ensure compliance with regulations such as GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA.

## Key Components

### 1. Data Protection (data_protection.py)
- Secure data encryption and decryption using AES and RSA
- Pseudonymization of sensitive data 
- Configurable protection levels (Encrypted, Pseudonymized, Anonymized)

### 2. Federated Learning (federated_learning.py, federated_client.py)
- Privacy-preserving distributed machine learning
- Model training without sharing raw data
- Secure aggregation of model updates
- Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) integration
- Differential Privacy implementation

### 3. Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (zkml_manager.py)
- Zero-knowledge proofs for model predictions
- Verifiable AI with privacy preservation
- Proof generation and validation

### 4. Secure Audit Log (audit_log.py)
- Tamper-resistant logging of AI operations
- Cryptographic verification of log integrity
- Compliance evidence generation

## Usage Examples

The `examples/` directory contains demonstration scripts showing how to use these components:
