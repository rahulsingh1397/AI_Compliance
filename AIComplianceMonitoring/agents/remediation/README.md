# Remediation Agent

The Remediation Agent is responsible for automatically addressing compliance issues identified by the monitoring system. It implements automated remediation actions for common compliance violations and manages the remediation workflow.

## Key Components

### 1. RemediationManager (manager.py)
- Core orchestration of remediation activities
- Prioritization of remediation tasks
- Integration with other system components
- Management of remediation workflows

### 2. RemediationActions (actions.py)
- Implementation of specific remediation actions
- Support for various remediation techniques:
  - Data masking
  - Access control adjustments
  - Configuration fixes
  - Compliance documentation updates

### 3. AIRemediationManager (ai_remediation_manager.py)
- AI-powered remediation decision making
- Learns from past remediation actions
- Suggests optimal remediation strategies
- Provides explainable remediation recommendations

### 4. Integration (integration.py)
- Interfaces with other agents (monitoring, reporting, etc.)
- Webhook and API integrations for external systems
- Notification delivery for remediation events
- Cross-system coordination

### 5. Default Configuration (default_config.py)
- Default remediation settings
- Remediation policy templates
- Threshold configurations
- Priority settings

## Integration with Other Agents

The Remediation Agent works closely with:
- Monitoring Agent - To receive alerts about compliance issues
- Data Discovery Agent - To identify sensitive data requiring protection
- Reporting Agent - To document remediation actions taken
- UI Agent - To provide remediation status and controls in the web interface

## Usage

The Remediation Agent is typically activated automatically in response to compliance alerts, but can also be manually triggered through the UI or API.

## Configuration

Configure the agent by modifying settings in `default_config.py` or through the web interface.
