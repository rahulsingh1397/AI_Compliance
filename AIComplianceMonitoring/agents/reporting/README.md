- **ReportGenerator (report_generator.py)**: Creates various report types with flexible formatting
- **ReportScheduler (report_scheduler.py)**: Manages scheduled and ad-hoc report generation
- **ReportStorage (report_storage.py)**: Handles secure storage and retrieval of compliance reports

### Scripts
- **generate_report.py**: Command-line utility for generating reports

## Report Types

The Reporting Agent can generate several types of reports:

1. **Compliance Summary Reports**: High-level overview of compliance status
2. **Detailed Violation Reports**: In-depth analysis of specific compliance violations
3. **Trend Analysis Reports**: Changes in compliance status over time
4. **Remediation Status Reports**: Status of remediation activities
5. **Audit-Ready Reports**: Formatted reports suitable for regulatory audits
6. **Custom Reports**: Configurable reports based on specific requirements

## Output Formats

Reports can be generated in multiple formats:
- PDF
- HTML
- JSON
- CSV
- Excel

## Features

- **Scheduled Reporting**: Automatic generation of reports on daily, weekly, monthly schedules
- **Ad-hoc Reporting**: On-demand report generation through UI or API
- **Secure Storage**: Encrypted storage of sensitive compliance information
- **Versioning**: Report versioning and change tracking
- **Templates**: Customizable report templates
