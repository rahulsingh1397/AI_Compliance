## System Architecture

The AI Compliance Monitoring system follows a modular, agent-based architecture where specialized agents handle distinct aspects of the compliance monitoring workflow. Each agent has a well-defined responsibility and communicates with other agents and system components through standardized interfaces.

The system is organized as follows:

```

│   ├── data_discovery/         # Data discovery agent

```

## Agent Modules

### Base Agent Framework

The `BaseAgent` class provides a common foundation for all specialized agents, ensuring consistent behavior and interfaces.

**Key Features:**
- Context manager for resource management
- Dependency injection for components
- Configuration management via dataclasses
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Health check functionality
- Logging and monitoring

**Implementation Status:** Implemented

**File Location:** `AIComplianceMonitoring/agents/base_agent.py`

### Data Discovery Agent

The Data Discovery Agent is responsible for identifying, scanning, and classifying sensitive data across various data sources.

**Key Features:**
- Dependency injection for components (NLP model, ML classifier, metadata handler)
- Parallel data processing
- Configuration management
- Resource management
- Robust error handling

**Implementation Status:** Implemented

**File Location:** `AIComplianceMonitoring/agents/data_discovery/`

### Monitoring Agent

The Monitoring Agent handles real-time log ingestion, anomaly detection, and alert generation from various data sources.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time log ingestion from cloud (AWS S3, Azure Blob) and on-premises sources (FR2.1)
- Unsupervised ML models (Isolation Forest, Autoencoders) for anomaly detection with false positive rate < 5% (FR2.3)
- Prioritized alerts (low, medium, high) for dashboard integration (FR2.4)

**Components:**
1. **LogIngestionModule** - Handles ingestion of logs from various sources
   - Parallel log processing
   - Incremental processing
   - Format normalization
   - Source connections management

2. **AnomalyDetectionModule** - Implements ML-based anomaly detection
   - Isolation Forest algorithm
   - Deep Learning-based Autoencoder
   - Model versioning and persistence
   - False positive rate management

3. **AlertModule** - Handles alert generation and management
   - Prioritization (low, medium, high)
   - Alert database management
   - Dashboard integration

**Implementation Status:** Scaffolded (core structure and stubs created)

**File Locations:**
- `AIComplianceMonitoring/agents/monitoring/agent.py`
- `AIComplianceMonitoring/agents/monitoring/log_ingestion.py`
- `AIComplianceMonitoring/agents/monitoring/anomaly_detection.py`
- `AIComplianceMonitoring/agents/monitoring/alert_module.py`

### Reporting Agent

The Reporting Agent handles automated compliance report generation, scheduling, and tamper-proof storage.

**Key Features:**
- Automated compliance reports for GDPR Article 30, CCPA, and HIPAA (FR3.1)
- Report scheduling and export in PDF/CSV formats (FR3.3)
- Tamper-proof report storage in PostgreSQL for 3 years (FR3.4)

**Components:**
1. **ReportGeneratorModule** - Creates compliance reports
   - Report data collection and aggregation
   - Template rendering
   - Multiple format export (PDF, CSV)

2. **ReportStorageModule** - Handles tamper-proof storage
   - Secure storage with integrity verification
   - Retention management (3 years)
   - Efficient retrieval with metadata filtering

3. **ReportSchedulerModule** - Manages report scheduling
   - Flexible scheduling (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly)
   - Schedule management
   - Automated execution

**Implementation Status:** Scaffolded (core structure and stubs created)

**File Locations:**

### UI Agent

The UI Agent provides the web interface for the AI Compliance Monitoring system.

**Key Features:**

- Authentication and authorization
- Dashboard visualization
- API endpoints for agent integration
- User settings management

**Implementation Status:** Partially implemented (API endpoint issues being addressed)

**File Locations:** `AIComplianceMonitoring/agents/ui_agent/`

**Known Issues:**
- API blueprint may not be properly registered causing 404 errors
- API endpoints for `/api/compliance_data` need to work with dashboard.js
- Dashboard requires data from other agents that are not yet fully implemented

### Other Agents

Several other agent directories have been created as placeholders for future development:

- **Integration Agent** - For integrating with external systems
- **Privacy Preserving Agent** - For privacy protection features
- **User Interface Agent** - Additional UI-related functionality

**Implementation Status:** Not yet implemented (empty directories)

## Current Implementation Status

The system's current implementation status is as follows:

✅ **Completed:**
