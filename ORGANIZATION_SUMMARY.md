# Code Organization Summary

## Completed Tasks

### File Reorganization
- Created dedicated `scripts` directories in data_discovery and reporting agents
- Moved `run_discovery_scan.py` to data_discovery/scripts
- Moved `generate_report.py` to reporting/scripts
- Consolidated requirements in setup.py with versioned dependencies
- Created consolidated requirements_consolidated.txt for reference

### Documentation Improvements
