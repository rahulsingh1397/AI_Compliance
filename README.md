# AI Compliance Monitoring

A comprehensive system for AI compliance monitoring, reporting, and integration designed to ensure regulatory compliance and ethical operation of AI systems.

## Overview

This project provides a modular, agent-based architecture for monitoring AI systems and ensuring compliance with various regulations and ethical standards. The system is designed to be extensible, allowing for easy integration with existing enterprise systems and adaptation to different compliance requirements.

## Key Components

### Agent Modules

- **Data Discovery Agent**: Scans systems to identify sensitive data subject to compliance requirements
- **Monitoring Agent**: Monitors AI system logs and activities for compliance violations
- **Privacy-Preserving Agent**: Implements privacy-enhancing technologies for AI systems
- **Remediation Agent**: Provides automated remediation for compliance issues
- **Reporting Agent**: Generates compliance reports and documentation
- **UI Agent**: Web interface for interacting with the compliance system

### Integrations

- Support for external compliance data sources
- Integration with enterprise systems like JIRA and QRadar
- Notification services via Slack and email

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or 3.10
- Required libraries (see `requirements.txt`)
