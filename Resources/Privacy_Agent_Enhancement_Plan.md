# Privacy-Preserving Agent: Update Notes & Enhancement Plan

---

## I. Recent Updates (July 2025)

This document outlines the latest enhancements to the Privacy-Preserving Agent and details the strategic roadmap for future development.

### 1. Architectural Review & Documentation
- **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Conducted a thorough review of the Privacy-Preserving Agent's architecture, including the `DataProtectionManager`, `FederatedLearningManager`, and the placeholder `ZKMLManager`.
- **Enhanced Documentation:** Significantly improved the docstrings within `federated_learning.py`, clarifying the purpose, parameters, and behavior of core functions to improve code maintainability and readability.

### 2. Integration of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)
- **Secure Aggregation:** The `FederatedLearningManager` has been upgraded to use Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) for model aggregation. This is a major privacy enhancement.
- **Technology Used:** Implemented using the `tenseal` library, which leverages the CKKS scheme for efficient computation on encrypted floating-point numbers.
- **Privacy Gain:** The server can now aggregate model updates from multiple clients **without ever decrypting them**. This protects the confidentiality of client contributions from a potentially compromised or untrusted server, a critical step towards a zero-trust architecture.

## II. Task List & Future Enhancements

This task list is based on the architectural review and outlines the next steps to build a state-of-the-art, multi-layered privacy-preserving system.

### Near-Term (High Priority)

- [ ] **Implement Client-Side FHE Workflow:**
    - **Encryption:** Update client logic to encrypt model updates using the FHE public key before sending them to the server.
    - **Decryption:** Design and implement a secure mechanism for clients to collectively decrypt the aggregated global model received from the server.

- [ ] **Integrate Differential Privacy (DP):**
    - **Goal:** Add formal, mathematical privacy guarantees to the federated learning process.
    - **Action:** Add calibrated noise to client model updates *before* FHE encryption. 
    - **Recommended Libraries:** `Opacus` (PyTorch) or `TensorFlow Privacy`.

- [ ] **Implement Basic Update Verification:**
    - **Goal:** Protect against simple model poisoning attacks.
    - **Action:** Secure the `_verify_update` function in the `FederatedLearningManager` using standard digital signatures to authenticate the origin of each model update.

### Mid-Term (Advanced Protection)

- [ ] **Complete Zero-Knowledge ML (ZKML) Implementation:**
    - **Goal:** Enable verifiable computation to prove the integrity of client training.
    - **Action:** Replace the placeholder `ZKMLManager` with a functional implementation. This involves compiling the ML model into a ZK-SNARK circuit.
    - **Recommended Frameworks:** `EZKL` or `Giza`.

- [ ] **Integrate ZKML with Federated Learning:**
    - **Goal:** Use ZK proofs to verify that clients are honestly following the training protocol.
    - **Action:** Have clients generate a ZK proof alongside their model update. The `FederatedLearningManager` will verify this proof before accepting the update for aggregation.

### Long-Term (System-Wide Integration)

- [ ] **Full System Integration:**
    - **Goal:** Create a seamless workflow between all privacy components.
    - **Action:** Define and implement the interaction patterns. For example, using the `DataProtectionManager` to encrypt the communication channels that transmit FHE-encrypted updates and ZK proofs.

- [ ] **Explore Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC):**
    - **Goal:** Evaluate alternative privacy-preserving aggregation techniques.
    - **Action:** Research and potentially prototype SMPC for aggregation as an alternative to FHE, which may offer performance benefits for certain operations.
    - **Recommended Libraries:** `PySyft` (OpenMined).
